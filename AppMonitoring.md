## 🎯 Objective

To design a monitoring strategy that ensures high availability, performance, and observability of the application in production and non-production environments.

---

## 📌 Why Application Monitoring?

- Detect performance bottlenecks early
- Ensure high availability and uptime
- Proactively alert on anomalies
- Measure user experience
- Support capacity planning
- Assist in root cause analysis during failures

## 📈 Key Performance Metrics

| Metric Category        | Metrics to Track                                         | Description |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Availability**       | Uptime %, Downtime Duration                              | % of time app is fully operational |
| **Latency**            | Response Time (avg, p95, p99)                            | Time taken to serve a request |
| **Error Rates**        | 4xx/5xx error %, Failed Transactions                     | Measures application health |
| **Traffic**            | Requests per second (RPS), Concurrent Users              | Load patterns on the app |
| **Resource Usage**     | CPU %, Memory %, Disk I/O, Network I/O                   | Infrastructure-level resource consumption |
| **Database Health**    | Query Latency, Connection Pool Size, Deadlocks           | Backend bottlenecks |
| **External Services**  | API Failure Rates, Response Time of External Dependencies | Monitor third-party services |
| **Logs & Events**      | Exception frequency, Custom Event Counts                 | Insight into runtime behavior |
| **User Experience**    | Apdex Score, Load Time, Error Clicks                     | End-user satisfaction indicator |

## 🧾 Functional Monitoring Requirements

- ✅ Track real-time request-response performance
- ✅ Alert on high latency, error spikes, or resource saturation
- ✅ Detect anomalies and trends over time
- ✅ Monitor specific business KPIs (e.g., transactions, orders, login failures)
- ✅ Provide dashboards for stakeholders
- ✅ Store historical metrics for trend analysis

---

## 🛠️ Technical Monitoring Requirements

- ✅ Instrument application with APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- ✅ Integrate with logging and tracing systems
- ✅ Support distributed tracing for microservices
- ✅ Integrate with alerting tools like PagerDuty, Slack, Email
- ✅ Collect metrics via agents (Node exporter, Prometheus, etc.)
- ✅ Role-based access to monitoring dashboards
- ✅ Export metrics via APIs for automation and audits

---

## 📊 Tool Recommendations

| Category        | Tools                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Metrics**     | Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, CloudWatch |
| **APM**         | New Relic, AppDynamics, Dynatrace, Elastic APM |
| **Logging**     | ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Fluentd |
| **Tracing**     | Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry       |
| **Alerting**    | Alertmanager, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, Grafana Alerts |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- ✅ Set SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and SLIs (Service Level Indicators)
- ✅ Alert only on actionable events to reduce noise
- ✅ Use thresholds, anomaly detection, and rate-of-change alerts
- ✅ Enable dashboards for engineering and business teams
- ✅ Monitor both infrastructure and application layers
- ✅ Automate recovery where possible (auto-scaling, restart policies)
